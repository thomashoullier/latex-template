\section{Usage}
Make sure you have a functioning LaTeX installation. We use \lstinline{TeX Live}
\cite{texlive}. Our target is \gls{PDF} output.

A \lstinline{latexmkrc} file provides the boilerplate code to produce the
required output, by simply running \lstinline{latexmk -pdf main.tex}.

\section{See also}
Further LaTeX template ideas and examples may be found in the following
references.

\begin{itemize}
\item The Overleaf documentation \cite{overleaf} has many high-quality
      pages about general LaTeX knowledge.
\item Scientific journals provide their LaTeX template for submissions,
      see for instance Optica \cite{optica-author-resources}. Inspiration
      may be drawn from these sources.
