# Personal LaTeX template
This is my personal LaTeX template for technical articles of length ranging
from a few pages to some dozens.

This template is mainly a collection of packages and customizations useful for
scientific writing in physics. The appearance is not particularly well
thought-out.

The PDF output of the template may be found on my website [1].

## Compile
Compile the document with, while in the same folder as `main.tex`:

```shell
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```
