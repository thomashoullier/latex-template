# Personal LaTeX template
This is my personal LaTeX template. As is the case with a lot of other people,
I arrived at this result by writing a PhD thesis.

This template is mainly a collection of packages useful for scientific writing
in physics. It is not particularly well presented.

**Coming soon:** Release 1.0 with PDF example.

## Compile
Compile the document with, while in the same folder as `main.tex`:

```shell
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```
